## Day 3 - High Fever ðŸ¤’

## Day 4 (16th Feb 2025) :

I had to research the skr board first because many pins are very confusing. I decided to go with the btt skr v1.4 board and I found this very useful link -

Also THANKS A LOT to whoever made this video

It helped me choose the stepper motor drivers because I did know if I needed uart and what jumpers I needed to use on the board! This is very confusing.
I am also using a touch screen - tft24

Now I have lots of things on my mind that I have to buy so I decided to start working with the bom sheet!

Here is the unfinished work of the spreadsheet:

Did many other stuff

## Day 7 (19th Feb 2025) I am feeling better than before!
## Total time 2 Hours!!! Started from 1 pm

Today I started working on the 3D model of my printer since I was bored to hell updating the BOM every day!

First, I needed to design the 4040 Extrusions! Luckily I found them on GrabCAD. Now I will make the Frame

Yeah, I had to watch so many tutorials and I was doing everything manually debugging a lot. Now I realize how bad I am :(. But I still made it!

## Day 8 to 11 (20 to 23rd Feb 2025) Sorry to lazy to write everything!
## Total time 3 Hours !!! 1 Hour Everyday

I worked on the cad files everyday and since i am a noob in fusion it took me some time to make the finl result of the frame with the heated!
