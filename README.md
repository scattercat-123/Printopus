# Printopus
The ultimate 3d printer was built by me.
Open the journey over here - [Printopus-Journey.md](Printopus-Journey.md)

## What I plan to add to the printer which is special from others!
<ul>
  <li>Filament run out sensor</li>
  <li>Custom lighting under the extruder</li>
  <li>Since most of the printers are mostly like a machine which has to just print things I am planning to add a user interactive game in the printer itself with the touchscreen!</li>
  <li>Automatic nozzle cleaner with silicone pads</li>
</ul>
## Extras!!
